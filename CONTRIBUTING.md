## Code of conduct

The Intelligence Community Design System (ICDS) has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Please familiarise yourself with our full [conduct principles](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

To find out more about the different types of contributions, the criteria or our roadmap, read [how to contribute to the Design System and UI Kit](https://design.sis.gov.uk/community/contribute).

### Making a suggestion or raising a bug

You can help us speed up the development of our test app by contributing new guidance, improving existing guidance or raising bugs.

Before getting started, please check our [Github issues](https://github.com/mi6/ui-kit-test-app/issues) page to check whether a similar bug or suggestion already exists. If not, create a ticket with as much information as possible. The working group will triage your ticket and get back to you. The working group meet on a fortnightly basis to review new tickets, but important bugs will be reviewed sooner.

### Contributing code

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is the build tool used to bundle and serve the test app during development. It provides fast and efficient hot module replacement (HMR) to enhance the development experience.

### Setting up the test app codebase

[Node 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to build and run the codebase.

If you would like to contribute code, please complete the following steps:

1. Fork the [test app repository](https://github.com/mi6/ui-kit-test-app) and clone your forked repo onto your device.
2. Make sure to add the `mi6/ui-kit-test-app` repo as your upstream remote branch, by running:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:mi6/ui-kit-test-app.git
```

3. Create a new branch in your forked repo, named after the issue number of your contribution (e.g. feature/123-new-feature).
4. Run the following:

**NPM**

```bash
npm install
npm run develop
```

**Yarn**

```bash
rm package-lock.json
yarn install
yarn run develop
```

5. Make your changes, keeping to the [coding standards and practices](#coding-standards-and-practices).
6. Commit your changes, as per the [Git commit style guide](#git-commit) and push to your branch.
7. Submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) to merge to the `develop` branch in the original repository:

   - Click on `Compare & pull request`.
   - Set the base to be the original repository's `develop` branch and the host to be your `forked branch`.
   - Click on `Create pull request`.

### Pull Requests

All changes will be reviewed via a pull request. Raise the pull request to merge to the `develop` branch. Provide details on what has been changed or added.

All pull requests will be reviewed by:

- Checking the change meets the guidance set out on this page.
- Checking the change meets the requirements of the ticket.
- Checking anything else deemed relevant by the reviewer.

Pull requests must have the approval of 2 reviewers before they can be merged into the `develop` branch.

## Coding standards and practices

### Accessibility

All changes must meet the criteria for [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://design.sis.gov.uk/accessibility/requirement/wcag). Find out more about the importance of [accessibility](https://design.sis.gov.uk/accessibility).

### Style guide

Linting tools are ran against the codebase to keep in line with our coding standards. The linting tools used are:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/):

Resolve linting and formatting issues via `npm run lint` and `npm run prettier:fix`.

### Git user configuration

As a data protection measure, this repository enforces the use of GitHub user email address in your commit. Please follow these steps:

1. Visit your [GitHub email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails)
   - Optionally check the settings "Keep my email addresses private" and "Block command line pushes that expose my email"
2. On this page, under **Primary Email Address** you'll see a user email that follows the pattern `<username>@users.noreply.github.com`.
3. Inside your developer environment, open a command line in the directory of the ui-kit-test-app repository
4. Enter the command `git config user.email <EMAIL>` where you replace `<EMAIL>` with the address from step 3. This will be applied to commits made in this repository.

### Git commit

Please ensure that your commits are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) when contributing to the test app repository.

### Amending a commit

If you need to make changes to a commit (for example, after receiving comments on a PR), follow these steps:

1. **If you're amending the most recent commit:**
   - Stage your changes using `git add` and include the files you want to update.
   - Run `git commit --amend --no-edit` to amend the most recent commit without changing the commit message.
   - The Commitizen prompt will still appear as if you are making a new commit. Exit the prompt (usually by pressing Ctrl+C).
   - Push the changes to the remote repository using: `git push --force`.

2. **If you're amending an older commit:**
   - Use `git rebase` to modify an older commit. For example, to modify commit `a1312407`, run:
     ```sh
     git rebase --interactive a1312407
     ```

   - In the default editor, change `pick` to `edit` for the line mentioning `a1312407`.

   - Save the file and exit. Git will interpret and automatically execute the commands in the file, placing you in the state just after creating commit `a1312407`.

   - Amend the commit by making your changes and then running:
     ```sh
     git commit --all --amend --no-edit
     ```

   - Continue the rebase process by running:
     ```sh
     git rebase --continue
     ```

   - Push the changes to the remote repository using:
     ```sh
     git push --force
     ```

### Styling

- Avoid using inline css.

## Testing

Tests should be sufficient enough for the functionality changed or added.

Testing should always include accessibility testing. Please read our advice on [how to test for accessibility](https://design.sis.gov.uk/accessibility/testing)

Tests should be added for both Cypress and React Testing Library.
